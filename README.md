# Search Page Plugin
WordPress plugin for creating a basic search page template for your WP site if your theme does not include one.

Not all themes display widget or header search fields in intuitive ways, so choose this plugin's "Search Page" template to offer users a dedicated, reliable, accessible place to search your site's content.
